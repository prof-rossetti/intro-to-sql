# Final Exam

## Section II: Logical Database Design

Reference the provided [table relations](/resources/exams/final/relations/).

For each relation, design a relational database to store the data in the most optimal way.
 Represent your design by drawing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in the space provided.

Each ERD should:

  + Communicate with clarity the proper logical database design
  + Represent all **entities**, and for each:
    + Represent any known or likely **attributes**
    + Denote each **primary key** attribute with `(pk)`; if the primary key is comprised of multiple attributes, denote each composite primary key attribute with `(cpk)`
    + Optionally denote each foreign key attribute with `(fk)`
  + Represent all direct **relationships** between entities, and for each:
    + Denote relationship **cardinality**, for each direction
    + Optionally denote relationship optionality, for each direction
    + Optionally describe the relationship in English, for each direction

State assumptions as necessary to justify answers.

You may make scratch-notes, but only ERDs will be considered for evaluation.
