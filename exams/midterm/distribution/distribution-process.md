For each file:

 + upload the .md file to http://www.markdowntopdf.com/
 + download the .pdf file, and save to this repository

## Collect Files

Open all files at the same time in Mac OS Preview app,
 and save the collection as a single .pdf file.

If that's not working, use http://www.pdfmerge.com/.

## Prepare Booklets

Print a copy per student, plus a few extras.

Staple each copy.
