# Midterm Exam

## Description

First, answer the [database concept questions](/resources/exams/midterm/questions/database-concept-questions.md). You shouldn't need anything else to answer these questions.

Then, take some time to examine the [table design](/resources/exams/midterm/tables.md). Draw a physical schema diagram if helpful for reference.

Finally, use the table design to answer the
  [physical design questions](/resources/exams/midterm/questions/physical-database-design-questions.md)
  and the
  [data analysis questions](/resources/exams/midterm/questions/data-analysis-questions.md).

Good Luck!
