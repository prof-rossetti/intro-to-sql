# Group Project Final Documentation Deliverable

Refer to the [Group Project Description](/PROJECT.md).

## Description

Plan and design an information system,
 including database and application software components,
 to address the business problem and information requirements
  identified during the [midterm pitch](midterm-pitch.md).

Write a detailed report which describes and documents your information system solution.

Reasonable submissions may contain over 100 pages of printed text and illustrations.

### Business Problem

Describe the nature of the business problem addressed by your system.

### Information System Solution

Describe system objectives, functions, information requirements, and scope.
 Describe the manner and methodology (e.g. Traditional/Waterfall vs Agile) by which the system will be developed, implemented, and adopted.

#### System Components

Describe system components and any monetary costs that may apply for the acquisition or implementation or maintenance of each.

##### Users and Interface

Describe user and interface considerations. Who will use the system and who will maintain it?
  In what manner will users interact with the system?

##### Hardware

What hardware (e.g. personal computers, web servers, mobile phones, tablets, sensors, monitors, routers, etc.) does the system require?

##### Software

What software (e.g. proprietary applications, software as a service, etc.) will instruct system logic,
 and what operating systems and programming languages and frameworks, if any, are involved?

##### Networks

What networking and communications technologies and protocols (e.g. HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP, WiFi, Bluetooth, WAN, LAN, VPN, broadband, fiber, etc.) does the system require?

##### Datastore

How does the system capture and store data? What database technologies does the system use?

What database concepts (e.g. Entities and Relationships) are included in the scope of the database design? What tables are included in the scope of the database design?
  For each table, identify column names, datatypes, and indices such as primary and foreign keys.
  In a data dictionary for each table, describe the meaning of each column/attribute name and give examples of valid column/attribute values.

In a visual diagram, illustrate the logical and physical database design.

In an appendix, provide the SQL queries used by the system to process information inputs into information outputs, and to process data into information.

Finally, describe data storage, availability, security, and privacy considerations.
