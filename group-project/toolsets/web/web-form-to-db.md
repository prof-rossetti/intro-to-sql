Reference the following
 example web form implementations
  which input results into a database:

 + https://github.com/gwu-business/salad-system-py (demo-ed in class; requires the greatest amount of hand-written custom code)
 + https://github.com/gwu-business/salad-system-flask (uses the Flask library to simplify URL routing, and simplify HTML views with use of templates)
 + https://github.com/gwu-business/salad-system-alchemy (builds on the "flask" implementation to include using the SQLAlchemy library to simplify database transactions)
 + https://github.com/gwu-business/salad-system-django (uses the Django web application framework for all the benefits of the "alchemy" implementation, but also simplifies development of web forms by including a built-in admin interface)
