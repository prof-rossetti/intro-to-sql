# Midterm Pitch

Refer to the [Group Project Description](/PROJECT.md).

## Description

Identify and research a real-world business problem which may benefit from a relational database system solution. Reference various [business prompt examples](/resources/group-project/examples) which have been provided to students in previous semesters. If your group experiences difficulty finding and describing a business problem, ask an instructor for help, or request to address one of the previously-provided prompts. You may also leverage university [new venture planning resources](http://newventure.gwu.edu/support-resources) for additional guidance.

Describe how a database system can solve the business problem, and describe the objectives and purpose of such a system. Describe the system's information requirements in terms of inputs and outputs. Optionally provide mock-ups or screenshots of information inputs like forms, and information outputs such as charts and reports.

Optionally produce a preliminary physical database table design that reflects the business problem and satisfies system objectives.

Present your work to the class and receive feedback.

### Presentation Requirements

Your presentation should cover the following content:

  + a business problem summary
  + a description of database system objectives
  + identification of information requirements (inputs and outputs)

You may optionally include preliminary table designs, interface designs, report mock-ups, etc.
