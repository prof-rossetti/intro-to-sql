# Group Project Final Implementation Deliverable

Refer to the [Group Project Description](/PROJECT.md).

## Description

Refer to the [system documentation deliverable](/final-documentation.md) which should describe system requirements and design.

Choose a [toolset](/resources/group-project/toolsets.md) based on system requirements, and implement your system design.

The implementation should include a fully-functional database, as well as enough software application functionality to facilitate capture of information inputs and conversion/processing of data into information outputs.

### System Implementation Objectives

The implementation should address the business problem and system objectives.

The implementation should include a functional relational database
 which adheres to reasonable design principles.

The implementation should include a script to populate data into an empty database, optionally loading data from a .csv or .txt file, or external API.

The implementation should capture data entered by humans, and store that data in the database.

The implementation should process data into at least three different example information outputs.

## Submission Instructions

Upload your working database system and any pertinent data files to [Blackboard](https://blackboard.gwu.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_6866128_1&course_id=_260328_1&assign_group_id=&mode=cpview).
 If implementing in MS Access, attach an compressed .mdb database file.
 Else if implementing with open source technologies, attach a compressed .sql database file.

If your implementation includes application software, attach to your submission a .zip file containing any relevant code repositories.

## Evaluation Methodology

Each database system implementation will be graded in terms of its demonstrated ability to address the system implementation objectives.
