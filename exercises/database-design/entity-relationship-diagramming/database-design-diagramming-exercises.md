# Entity Relationship Diagramming (ERD) Exercises

These exercises add an additional diagramming layer to the [conceptual design exercises](/resources/database-design/conceptual-design/conceptual-design-exercises.md).

## Description

For each [example relational database table design](/resources/database-design/physical-design/examples):

  + Identify all known or likely indices and specify which are primary keys and which are foreign keys, as applicable.
  + Identify all entities and relationships, including relationship classifications, cardinality, and optionality.
  + **Draw/sketch an ERD to represent the database design**.
  + Write a simple query to join the two tables together.

Explicitly state your assumptions to provide additional justification for your answers.
